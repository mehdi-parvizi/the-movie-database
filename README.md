# The movie database
this project features a responsive movie info database using www.tmdb.org api to show movies or series, can be categorized based on genre

you have to provide your own API key to be able to use this code

the search functionality is implemented to search for series, movies and people

uppon clicking on a media title(series or movies) you're routed to that media page showing the full overview, recommendations, and a youtube video related to that media
when clicking on a person name you can see what series or movies they played or directed and their release dates (people are only accessible if you search for them)
